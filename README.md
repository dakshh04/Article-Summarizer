## More About this project

The application uses the OpenAI article summarizer API from rapid-api.com to generate summaries of articles.
The project incorporates Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a convenient and efficient way to design the user interface of the application. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development by providing a set of utility classes that can be easily applied to HTML elements.

In addition to React and Tailwind CSS, project also utilizes Vite.js. Vite.js is a fast and opinionated development tool that allows for quick setup and development of modern web applications. It offers features such as hot module replacement, fast bundling, and a dev server with instant server-side rendering.

By combining React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.js,project provides a responsive and visually appealing user interface for the Article Summarizer Application. Users can input the URL of an article they want to summarize, and the application sends a request to the OpenAI article summarizer API. The API processes the article and returns a summarized version, which is then displayed to the user.

Furthermore, the application keeps a record of the five most recent links that have been searched. This feature allows users to easily access and refer back to previously summarized articles without the need to re-enter the URLs.
